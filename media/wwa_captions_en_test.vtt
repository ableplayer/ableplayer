NOTE This VTT file includes a few extras: 
- Meta data at the top (lines 2 and 3)
- The current comment block, identified with NOTE and surrounded by spaces 
- cue settings at the end of the first timestamp 
- A cue span at the start of the second cue payload 
- (in this case, a "voice span" <v> identifying the speaker)
- A WebVTT cue settings list after the timestamp at 39.132 
- Currently AblePlayer does not support these extra features 
- but the parser needs to be able to filter them out 
-
- Added on April 1, 2015 for testing purposes (these are both valid): 
- A cue block with no content 
- Multiple line breaks between some cue blocks 
-
- More info in the WebVTT spec (still evolving):

<v Narrator> You want these people.


00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.759 
They order your products, sign up for your services,

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.627
enroll in your classes, read your opinions,

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:18.561
and watch your videos.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:24.165
You'll never see them, but they know you-
through your website.

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:25.891
Or maybe not.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:30.396
Your website's visitors aren't a 
faceless mass of identical mouse-clickers

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.363
but a vibrant community of individuals 

00:00:32.363 --> 00:00:35.297
with varying tastes, styles, and abilities.

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:39.132
This includes people with disabilities.

[Terrill] It's important for web designers and developers

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500
to realize that what they see currently on their computer,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.264
at their resolution, with their browser
and their operating system

00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:52.000
is not going to be necessarily 
the same thing that everybody else sees.
