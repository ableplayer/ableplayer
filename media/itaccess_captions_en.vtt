00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.740
<v Michael  K. Young> We are committed
to the notion that <i>everyone</i>

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.600
should have an opportunity
to participate in higher education

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.000
whether it be from the learning perspective
or the research perspective

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.550
or an opportunity to <i>work</i> here
at this institution.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.970
We benefit from that because we get
to enjoy the <b>talents</b> and the <b>skills</b>

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.230
of those people who come in
and also their <b>perspective</b>

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.600
which in many cases will be different
from the perspective of others on campus.

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:29.095
So accessibility becomes
<b>a very important value</b> at the university.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Tracy Mitrano> We're a leading university globally.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.400
We want the best talent in the world
for our students, our staff, and our faculty.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.600
And we want to be sure
if that talent has a disability

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:58.315
that they know that we are
a welcoming community.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:01:04.000
<v Pablo Molina> We're competing with other
prestigious and highly accomplished institutions.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.540
We want to make sure that we
can target the right candidates

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.500
to join our community
regardless of their disability status.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Pete Siegel> We want to do everything we can
to ensure that they have the same access

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:22.747
to smart faculty, to fellow students,
and to the resources at UC Davis.

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:28.693
<v Edward Ray> In fact, we genuinely believe
that excellence is achieved through diversity

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:32.053
and that a commitment to equity and inclusion

00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:34.800
really enriches each of our lives.

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:41.757
<v Linda Cahill> It would be inconceivable
not to have a social conscience at least,

00:01:41.757 --> 00:01:44.857
and be completely committed

00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:50.000
to making our resources at Barry University
accessible to all students.

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.075
<v Edward Ray> We believe that the use of technology
can be very powerful.

00:01:55.075 --> 00:02:00.716
It connects people to each other,
but it also enhances their learning capabilities;

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:06.509
it increases what they can do
through their research and creative work;

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.540
it really makes it possible for them
to have a more powerful impact

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.100
in the world and that's basically
what we're all about.

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:18.022
And we want that to be true
for every member of our community,

00:02:18.022 --> 00:02:26.520
regardless of limitations, of physical,
spatial, time or other dimension.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:28.279
<v Hernan LondoÃ±o> As an IT professional...

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:34.978
sometimes some of us concentrate
in the technical side of the house only

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:39.295
and we forget that finally
the technology is to serve the people.

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:42.195
<v Michael K. Young> What the university offers
and makes available

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.100
has to be offered to everybody.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.700
We can't afford to waste the talents
or the brilliance or the minds of anybody

00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:51.252
and making things accessible

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.040
allows everybody to engage in the university.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.900
Equal opportunity is
a part of our value system,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.400
but it's also required by law.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.440
<v Pete Siegel> Compliance is extremely important.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.200
Compliance is the law.

00:03:03.296 --> 00:03:06.855
But that isn't the motivator
for most of us at universities.

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:12.800
Our motivation has always been to provide
easily accessible tools,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.760
excellent experiences for our students,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.255
and really to give them the sense
that this is a place they want to be,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:22.519
a place they want to learn,
a place where they can thrive.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Michael K. Young> Universal design
is a very powerful concept

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.800
because what it means is we look at the issue
of accessibility at the outset

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.300
rather than buying something or
engaging something or developing something

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.000
that we have to retrofit

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:46.247
which not only makes it
cheaper and more efficient,

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.000
it likely makes it much better

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:51.735
in terms of both the quality of the product
and the accessibility to those...

00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:54.394
all the people that we want to be able to use it.

00:03:54.394 --> 00:03:56.600
<v Tracy Mitrano> I think the other direction

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.500
that colleges and universities
could and should take

00:03:59.507 --> 00:04:06.342
is to think about accommodation as really
the beginning of the conversation about disability.

00:04:06.342 --> 00:04:10.842
It was the appropriate measure that was taken
in the Americans with Disabilities Act

00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:16.000
that was passed in 1990
and that's well over a generation ago.

00:04:16.007 --> 00:04:20.892
I think now we really have to think less
about how we're going to measure

00:04:20.892 --> 00:04:24.159
specifically this accommodation
or that accommodation

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.708
and recognize that we can
make accessibility open and available

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.528
so that individual staff, faculty or students

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:34.000
do not have to go to get an accommodation.

00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:36.188
It will be automatically available

00:04:36.188 --> 00:04:39.700
in the webpage that they visit,
in the device that they use.

00:04:39.757 --> 00:04:45.217
<v Brady Deaton> We envision a campus
that has a concept of universal design

00:04:45.217 --> 00:04:47.400
in all aspects of information technology,

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:50.054
that a student is not impeded in any way,

00:04:50.054 --> 00:04:54.147
but in fact, that technology is utilized
not only directly by those who benefit

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:58.280
because of certain challenges they may have,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.640
but also is illustrative
to the broader student body

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.400
and to the faculty and to alums

00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:07.121
about what an inclusive learning environment is.

00:05:07.121 --> 00:05:09.800
<v Pete Siegel> We have some things we have to learn

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200
in order to move into accessibility space,

00:05:11.287 --> 00:05:15.549
but the basic goals and the basic values
are things we already know and love.

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.489
Then we bring in things like universal design,

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:22.700
the notion that if we design things well
right from the start,

00:05:22.703 --> 00:05:25.070
they actually aren't more expensive.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.569
This is something that we can fit into
even our very, very tight budgets.

00:05:39.338 --> 00:05:41.338
<v Eileen McDonough> We make a great effort

00:05:41.338 --> 00:05:44.200
in our graduate and our undergraduate counsel

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.660
to make sure that faculty and deans
are aware that in program design,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.400
in offering a new major,
that they take into account

00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:58.558
that they might have to have
specialized software available

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:03.033
and they have to build that into
their program development.

00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:10.650
And then to certainly just be aware
of all the different ways that students can learn,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.400
to help faculty and deans understand
the concept of universal design.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.066
<v Gerry Hanley> The first step really
needs to be an assessment of where we are

00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:28.513
so we can then inform
our planning process,

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.065
develop plans,
implement a project,

00:06:31.065 --> 00:06:33.225
<v Pablo Molina> Key to our approach to making
sure that our campus and our technology is

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:37.000
to making sure that our campus and our technology

00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:39.664
is accessible to people with disabilities

00:06:39.664 --> 00:06:41.000
is to ensure we do this by design.

00:06:41.074 --> 00:06:46.752
This is not an afterthought that we do
after we have implemented a new classroom.

00:06:46.752 --> 00:06:52.903
Instead, this is something that we do
from the initial conception of a new project or idea.

00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:58.233
The same way we do this for privacy and security,
we do this for accessibility.

00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:00.933
<v Bruce Maas> It is less costly, in the long run

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:06.000
to be thinking through the issues
of accessibility comprehensively.

00:07:06.048 --> 00:07:11.010
Therefore, having a plan for accessibility
ensures that from the beginning

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.048
we think through our issues with regard
to the delivery of our services.

00:07:16.048 --> 00:07:23.001
Doing so in a strategic way means that we
can hold down costs over the long haul

00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.617
and actually deliver better services in the bargain.

00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:33.585
<v Brady Deaton> It is very important that
a university follows a policy and a process

00:07:33.585 --> 00:07:36.003
that is a can-do kind of process.

00:07:36.003 --> 00:07:39.535
It assumes that we are going to undertake
the investments that we need,

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:42.018
we're going to demonstrate the value that we need,

00:07:42.018 --> 00:07:45.338
that not only address the needs of students

00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:47.800
who may be challenged with vision or hearing
or other disabilities,

00:07:47.849 --> 00:07:52.049
but also draw on the technology

00:07:52.049 --> 00:07:55.200
that is not only exciting for those people
who are developing the technology,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.000
it's intellectually exciting.
It provides new jobs for that matter

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.622
and it stimulates learning
in so many parts of the university.

00:08:02.622 --> 00:08:07.102
So that attitude of the university administration,

00:08:07.102 --> 00:08:09.900
as well as faculty and staff and students,

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:12.829
becomes very, very important
because everyone gains from this.

00:08:12.829 --> 00:08:14.700
It's a win-win situation.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.661
<v Tracy Mitrano> A policy really is
an important way to go

00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.901
because it will focus
everyone's attention.

00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.381
It's also probably the way
that you have to go now that

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.080
there are legal pressures
on higher education in this area.

00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:29.681
The second thing I would say about policy

00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:33.000
is there are really two types in general.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:35.420
One is a policy that you have
because you have a law

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.420
for example the Family Education
Rights Privacy Act Policy

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.400
so you want to be clear and sure

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.000
that you're going to have
compliance on your campus.

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:49.529
There's another kind of policy that
I would call aspirational policy

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.300
and maybe accessibility fits
a little bit in both

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:56.642
but you most certainly can err on
the aspirational side.

00:08:56.642 --> 00:09:01.000
An aspirational policy is something
you establish for your institution

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.944
as a path moving towards something,
moving forward.

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:07.434
It does not have to have
one hundred percent compliance

00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:11.611
because it's really a direction that you're
setting strategically for your institution.

00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:17.291
<v Gerry Hanley> I'd say another
critical aspect around our strategy

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.700
is a shared governance strategy.

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:25.586
Because education is a
shared responsibility

00:09:25.586 --> 00:09:30.600
across faculty, staff,
students, vendors,

00:09:30.615 --> 00:09:36.496
all of us working together
have to share in that responsibility.

00:09:36.496 --> 00:09:43.116
Now, a shared governance process means
if you are responsible in delivering the service,

00:09:43.116 --> 00:09:45.200
then you have an opportunity

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.100
to share in governing
how we're going to manage

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.100
the implementation of these services.

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.460
<v Brady Deaton> The administrators
of the university must reflect the values

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.100
that demonstrate the importance of this
to the learning environment

00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:01.059
and it has to be built in then
to every aspect of what we do.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Michael K. Young> Right now we have a number
of projects and initiatives underway at the UW

00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:07.393
in which we're testing new technologies.

00:10:07.393 --> 00:10:11.043
Accessibility is an important consideration
in these evaluations.

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:16.693
Many of the vendors we work with have completed
Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates or VPATs

00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:19.110
which offer a checklist of accessibility criteria

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.443
and vendors' self-assessment as to
how well they meet those criteria.

00:10:23.473 --> 00:10:26.553
It's a good starting point,
but we go beyond that

00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:28.600
to ask a vendor specific questions
and to test their products

00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:31.028
with respect to accessibility.

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:37.796
<v Gerry Hanley> We begin with our vendors saying
(a) this is not only important,

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:41.928
that this is required
for working with the CSU.

00:10:41.928 --> 00:10:46.148
Every student who comes into our institution

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:50.500
we have to provide equally effective
access to those services

00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:54.175
and you are a partner
in delivering those services to us.

00:10:54.175 --> 00:11:03.093
So we will tell you what we need and then
we will help you inform your staff, educate your staff,

00:11:03.093 --> 00:11:08.290
provide them some consultation and guidance
in partnership with us,

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.757
so you can deliver
the successful service for us.

00:11:11.757 --> 00:11:15.777
<v Pat Burns> So we work with our vendors
to try to put pressure on them

00:11:15.777 --> 00:11:17.800
to make things accessible.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.860
We actually have a purchasing process
where we work through

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.100
and ask the issues about accessibility

00:11:25.157 --> 00:11:29.324
for software and hardware
that we buy as well.

00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:33.823
<v Bruce Maas> Individual efforts really
need to be able to scale well.

00:11:33.823 --> 00:11:38.083
If we go about things in an ad hoc approach,
one by one,

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:39.900
we're not likely to get the same results

00:11:39.923 --> 00:11:43.858
as if we work together as a community
in higher education

00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:48.318
to work with vendors
to improve accessibility for everyone

00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:49.900
with regard to the products that are offered.

00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:55.269
That's a much more pragmatic approach
rather than institution by institution.

00:11:55.269 --> 00:12:02.003
<v Gerry Hanley> Making accessibility a priority
in their development roadmap

00:12:02.003 --> 00:12:05.609
is going to be driven by the market demand.

00:12:05.609 --> 00:12:13.459
And if an institution never says a word,
the vendor isn't going to do anything about it.

00:12:13.459 --> 00:12:17.299
So if we begin to communicate
our demands collectively

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.760
then the vendor will recognize
the market value of accessibility.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.660
<v Joel Hartman> As we acquire IT resources,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:26.800
we have to embed accessibility
in our contracts.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.400
As we develop resources,
we have to employ universal design

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.100
in our thinking about
how to make these resources available

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.800
and we have to continue to monitor students
to see if we're really delivering to them

00:12:36.831 --> 00:12:40.000
we're really delivering to them the resources
in a form that they can actually use.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Michael K. Young> Accessibility requires effort
on the part of everyone

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.100
in the higher education community...

00:12:55.122 --> 00:12:56.709
faculty, staff, technology vendors.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.475
If we all do our part,
our institutions can provide everyone

00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:02.935
with an equal opportunity to participate.

00:13:02.935 --> 00:13:06.400
And we all benefit from the
perspectives of a diverse group.

00:13:06.498 --> 00:13:10.458
<v Hernan LondoÃ±o> Having that peace of mind
that we are doing all we can

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:13.778
to provide an accessible campus is -
gives us a lot of pride

00:13:13.778 --> 00:13:18.000
and we feel very happy about what,
what we do.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.610
<v Linda Cahill> Why wouldn't we make our campus
accessible to students with disabilities

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.100
and why wouldn't we do
everything we could

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.300
to see the technology
is accessible to our students?

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:31.635
<v Tracy Mitrano> The spirit
of what has made higher education

00:13:31.635 --> 00:13:34.300
the jewel in the crown
of American society

00:13:34.325 --> 00:13:38.123
is part and parcel of
the message of accessibility.

00:13:38.123 --> 00:13:41.100
<v Edward Ray> Every way in which
we touch the lives of others,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.460
whether it's in the classroom,
the laboratory,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.300
through live performances,
through events on campus,

00:13:49.356 --> 00:13:54.876
we want everyone who comes here
and creates those experiences

00:13:54.876 --> 00:14:02.600
to be as fully engaged and as fully benefited
by the activity as possible.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:10.640
And that simply can't be done if people have
artificial challenges or barriers to try to overcome.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:14.728
I would say to those out there
who are just getting started

00:14:14.728 --> 00:14:17.208
or maybe struggling to figure out

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:22.500
how to use technology to advance
accessibility on their campuses

00:14:22.594 --> 00:14:26.592
that there's no such thing
as a bad time to start.
