{"name":"Able Player","tagline":"Fully accessible cross-browser HTML5 media player. ","body":"Able Player\r\n==========\r\n\r\n*Able Player* is a fully accessible cross-browser media player. It uses\r\nthe HTML5 \\<audio\\> or \\<video\\> element for browsers that support them,\r\nand (optionally) the JW Player as a fallback for those that don’t.\r\n\r\nTo see the player in action check our [Able Player Examples][examples] page.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\n-   Supports both audio and video.\r\n-   Supports either a single audio track or an entire playlist.\r\n-   A full set of player controls that are keyboard-accessible, properly labeled for screen reader users, and controllable by speech recognition users. \r\n-   Customizable keyboard shortcuts that enable the player to be operated from anywhere on the web page (unless there are multiple instances of the player on a given page; then the player must have focus for keyboard shortcuts to work).  \r\n-   High contrast, scalable controls that remain visible in Windows High Contrast mode, plus an easy-to-see focus indicator so keyboard users can easily tell which control currently has focus. \r\n-   Support for closed captions and subtitles in Web Video Timed Text (WebVTT) format, the standard format recommended by the HTML5 specification.   \r\n-   Support for chapters, also using WebVTT. Chapters are specific landing points in the video, allowing video content to have structure and be more easily navigated. \r\n-   Support for text-based audio description, also using WebVTT. At designated times, the description text is read aloud by screen readers.  Users can optionally set their player to pause when audio description starts in order to avoid conflicts between the description and program audio. \r\n-   Support for audio description as a separate video. When two videos are available (one with description and one without), both can be delivered together using the same player and users can toggle between the versions. \r\n-   Support for adjustable playback rate. Users who need to slow down the video in order to better process and understand its content can do so; and users who need to speed up the video in order to maintain better focus can do so. \r\n-   An interactive transcript feature, built from the WebVTT caption and description files as the page is loaded. Users can click anywhere in the transcript to start playing the video (or audio) at that point.  Keyboard users can also choose to keyboard-enable the transcript, so they can tab through its content one caption at a time and press enter to play the media at the desired point. \r\n-   Automatic text highlighting within the transcript as the media plays. This feature is enabled by default but can be turned off if users find it distracting. \r\n-   Support for playing YouTube videos within the AblePlayer chrome.  \r\n-   Optional seamless integrated support for JW Player as a fallback player for users whose browsers don't support HTML5 media. The fallback player uses the same custom interface and provides a nearly identical experience.\r\n-   Extensive customization. Many of the features described above are controlled by user preferences. This is based on the belief that every user has different needs and there are no one-size-fits-all solutions. This is the heart of universal design. \r\n    \r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n*Able Player* has been tested with the following browsers and assistive\r\ntechnologies.\r\n\r\n-   Firefox 3.x and higher\r\n-   Internet Explorer 7 and higher\r\n-   Google Chrome 7.0 and higher\r\n-   Opera 10.63 and higher\r\n-   Safari 5.0 on Mac OS X\r\n-   Safari on IOS 3.2.2 and higher (audio only, video plays in default IOS player)\r\n-   Chrome on Android 4.2 and higher\r\n\r\nNote that mobile browsers have limitations (e.g., volume control and autostart are not supported) \r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n*Able Player* has a few dependencies, but most are either provided with\r\n*Able Player* or available through Google’s hosted libraries. The one\r\nexception is the fallback player—see the *Fallback* section below for\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n-   *Able Player* uses [jQuery][]. The example code\r\n    below uses Google’s hosted libraries; no download required.\r\n-   *Able Player* uses [Modernizr][] to enable styling of HTML5 elements\r\n    in Internet Explorer 6 through 8. A Modernizr 2.6.2 Custom Build is\r\n    distributed with *Able Player*, and is all that *Able Player* needs.\r\n-   *Able Player* uses [jquery.cookie][] to store and retrieve user\r\n    preferences in cookies. This script is distributed with *Able\r\n    Player*.\r\n\r\nFallback\r\n--------\r\n\r\nFor older browsers that don’t support HTML5 media elements, you need a\r\nfallback solution. *Able Player* was developed to work seamlessly with\r\n[JW Player][], specifically **JW Player 6**. JW Player is free for\r\nnon-commercial use but is licensed separately and is not distributed\r\nwith *Able Player*. If you choose to use JW Player as your fallback\r\nplayer, users with older browsers including Internet Explorer 6-8 will\r\nhave the same experience with *Able Player* as users with newer\r\nbrowsers. Identical functionality has been attained using both the HTML5\r\nand JW Player APIs. After licensing and downloading JW PLayer, copy\r\n*jwplayer.js*, *jwplayer.html5.js*, and *jwplayer.flash.swf* into the\r\n*Able Player* */thirdparty* directory.\r\n\r\nNote that *most* browsers in use today support HTML5 media elements.\r\nHere’s a breakdown:\r\n\r\n-   Chrome since 3.0\r\n-   Firefox since 3.5\r\n-   Safari since 3.1\r\n-   Opera since 10.5\r\n-   Internet Explorer since 9.0\r\n\r\nAt some point we may decide that it’s reasonable to stop supporting a\r\nfallback player. However, according to [WebAIM’s 2014 Screen Reader User\r\nSurvey][] 19.8% of screen reader users are still using Internet Explorer 8, 7, or 6. Until these users catch up, we think we have to provide a\r\nworking fallback.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative fallback, you could link to the media file so users\r\ncan download it and play it on their player of choice, and/or provide a\r\ntranscript.\r\n\r\nSetup Step 1: Use HTML5 Doctype\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n*Able Player* is built on the HTML5 media elements, so at the top of\r\nyour web page be sure you have the HTML5 doctype:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup Step 2: Add JavaScript and CSS\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the following code into your web page. This code applies\r\nto all use cases, both audio and video.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<!-- Dependencies -->\r\n<script src=\"thirdparty/modernizr.custom.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"thirdparty/jquery.cookie.js\"></script>\r\n \r\n<!-- CSS --> \r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/ableplayer.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>\r\n \r\n<!-- JavaScript -->\r\n<script src=\"build/ableplayer.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetup Step 3: Add HTML\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAdd an HTML5 \\<audio\\> or \\<video\\> element to your web page, as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n### Audio\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the following code into your web page, replacing the\r\nsource files with the path to your own media files. Use both OGG and MP3\r\nto ensure cross-browser compatibility, since some browsers don’t support\r\nMP3.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<audio id=\"audio1\" data-able-player preload=\"auto\">\r\n  <source type=\"audio/ogg\" src=\"path_to_audio_file.ogg\"/>\r\n  <source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"path_to_audio_file.mp3\"/>\r\n</audio>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following attributes are supported on the \\<audio\\> element:\r\n\r\n-   **id** - required; any unique ID\r\n-   **data-able-player** - required \r\n-   **data-start-time** - optional; time at which you want the audio to start playing (in seconds)\r\n-   **preload** - optional; tells the browser how much media to download\r\n    when the page loads. If the media is the central focus of the web\r\n    page, use **preload=“auto”**, which instructs the browser to\r\n    download as much of the media as possible. If the media is not a\r\n    central focus, downloading the entire media resource can consume\r\n    valuable bandwidth, so preload=“metadata” would be a better option.\r\n\r\n### Video\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the following code into your web page, replacing the\r\nsource files with the path to your own media files.\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<video id=\"video1\" data-able-player preload=\"auto\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" poster=\"path_to_image.jpg\">\r\n  <source type=\"video/webm\" src=\"path_to_video.webm\" data-desc-src=\"path_to_described_video.webm\"/>\r\n  <source type=\"video/mp4\" src=\"path_to_video.mp4\" data-desc-src=\"path_to_described_video.mp4\"/>\r\n  <track kind=\"captions\" src=\"path_to_captions.vtt\"/>\r\n  <track kind=\"descriptions\" src=\"path_to_descriptions.vtt\"/>\r\n</video>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following attributes are supported on the \\<video\\> element:\r\n\r\n-   **id** - required; any unique ID\r\n-   **data-able-player** - required\r\n-   **data-start-time** - optional; time at which you want the video to start playing (in seconds)\r\n-   **data-transcript-div** - optional; id of an external div in which to display the interactive transcript. \r\n    The transcript is generated automatically if captions and/or descriptions are available. \r\n    If this attribute is not provided the transcript will be displayed in its default container  \r\n    adjacent to the player.  \r\n-   **data-youtube-id** - optional; 11-character YouTube id \r\n-   **preload** - optional; use “auto” or “metadata”. See explanation\r\n    above under *Audio*.\r\n-   **width** - width of the video in pixels. If not provided will\r\n    default to 480.\r\n-   **height** - height of the video in pixels. If not provided will\r\n    default to 360.\r\n-   **poster** - path to an image file. Will be displayed in the player\r\n    until the video is played.\r\n\r\nThe following additional features are supported by *Able Player*:\r\n\r\n#### Multiple source files\r\n\r\nAs with audio, we recommend including two versions of each video, one in\r\nH.264 (MP4) and another in WebM or OGG for browsers that don’t support\r\nMP4. Browsers will play the first media source that they support.\r\n\r\n#### Closed Captions\r\n\r\nCaptions are added using the \\<track\\> element with kind=“captions”.\r\nCaptions must be in Web Video Text Tracks format ([WebVTT][http://dev.w3.org/html5/webvtt/]). WebVTT\r\ntags within captions are currently ignored.  \r\n\r\nIf captions are provided, a CC button will be added to the\r\n*Able Player* controller.\r\n\r\n#### Audio Description\r\n\r\nSupplemental description of key visual content for blind users can be\r\nadded using one of two methods.\r\n\r\nThe first method is the same as closed captions, a \\<track\\> element, with\r\nkind=“descriptions”. This points to a WebVTT file, which is essentially\r\nthe same as a closed caption file, but its contents are description text\r\nrather than captions. With this method, description text is written to a\r\ncontainer that has ARIA role=“alert”. Supporting screen readers\r\nautomatically announce the new text as soon as it is written to the\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe second method is to produce a separate video with description mixed\r\nin. If multiple video sources are already provided (e.g., an MP4 and\r\nWebM file), then the described version must be available in both of\r\nthese formats. For each video source that has a described version\r\navailable, add a **data-desc-src** attribute to the \\<source\\> element for\r\nthat video. The value of this attribute is a path pointing to the\r\ndescribed version of the video. With this method, the described version\r\nof the video can be played instead of the non-described version, and the\r\ntwo versions can be swapped with clicking the “D” button on the\r\ncontroller.\r\n\r\nIf descriptions are available using either of the above methods, a\r\nDescription toggle button appears on the controller (represented by the\r\nuniversal Description symbol, the letter “D”). How descriptions are\r\nultimately delivered depends on which of the above methods is used, and\r\non user preference. If a user prefers text-based description announced\r\nby their screen reader, that’s what they’ll get. If they prefer an\r\nalternate video with description mixed in, that’s what they’ll get. See\r\nthe section below on *User Preferences* for additional information about\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\nSetup Step 4: Review User-Defined Variables in *ableplayer.js*\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe JavaScript file *initialize.js* includes a block of user-defined\r\nvariables that can be modified from their default settings, such as\r\nvolume, color of controller buttons, seek interval for rewind and\r\nforward buttons, and others. Explanations of each variable are provided\r\nin the comments.\r\n\r\nIf you make changes to this or any other JavaScript script files,  \r\nthe player will need to be recompiled before your changes will take effect. \r\nTo do so, run the shell script *compile.sh*. \r\n\r\nPlaylists\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAn *Able Player* playlist is an HTML list of tracks. The list can be\r\neither ordered (\\<ol\\>) or unordered (\\<ul\\>). The following attributes\r\nare supported on the list element:\r\n\r\n-   **class** - required; must be **able-playlist**\r\n-   **data-player** - required; must reference the ID of the media\r\n    player in which the playlist should be played.\r\n-   **data-embedded** - optional; add this attribute if you want your\r\n    playlist to be embedded into the media player. If this attribute is\r\n    omitted, the playlist will be external to the player and will appear\r\n    wherever you place it on the web page.\r\n\r\nWithin the playlist, each list item must include data-\\* attributes\r\nwhere \\* is the media type and the value of the attribute is the URL\r\npointing to the media file of that type. For example, the following\r\naudio playlist includes three songs, each of which is available in MP3\r\nand OGG:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<ul class=\"able-playlist\" data-player=\"audio1\" data-embedded>\r\n  <li data-mp3=\"song1.mp3\" data-ogg=\"song1.ogg\">My First Song</li>\r\n  <li data-mp3=\"song2.mp3\" data-ogg=\"song2.ogg\">My Second Song</li>\r\n  <li data-mp3=\"song3.mp3\" data-ogg=\"song3.ogg\">My Third Song</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Supported data-\\* audio types:**\r\n\r\n-   mp3\r\n-   ogg or oga\r\n-   wav\r\n\r\n**Supported data-\\* video types:**\r\n\r\n-   mp4\r\n-   webm or webmv\r\n-   ogg or ogv\r\n\r\nWhen a playlist is included on a page, the \\<source\\> elements within\r\nthe \\<audio\\> or \\<video\\> tags are optional. If they are provided, they\r\nshould match the first item in the playlist.\r\n\r\nIf your web page includes a playlist, you should also link to the\r\n*ableplayer-playlist.css* file, as follows:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/ump-playlist.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nInteractive Transcript\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\n*Able Player* interactive transcripts are generated automatically from \r\nWebVTT caption and description files. If a transcript is available, a Transcript \r\nbutton will be added to the *Able Player* controller. \r\n\r\nFeatures of the interactive transcript include the following:  \r\n\r\n-   Clicking anywhere in the transcript starts playing the media at that\r\n    point.\r\n-   This same functionality is accessible to keyboard users, who can tab\r\n    through the transcript and press Enter at any point to start playing\r\n    the media at that point. Since this creates a lot of extra tab stops\r\n    on the page, this might be undesirable functionality for some\r\n    keyboard users so it’s disabled by default. It can be toggled on/off\r\n    in the Preferences dialog.\r\n-   Text in the transcript is highlighted as the media plays. This can\r\n    be toggled on/off in the Preferences dialog.\r\n-   If subtitles are available, the transcript can be displayed in any supported language. \r\n    Available languages can be selected from a dropdown select field.      \r\n\r\nYouTube Support\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nTo play a YouTube video in *Able Player*, simply include the **data-youtube-id** attribute \r\non the \\<video\\> element. The value of this attribute must be the video's 11-character YouTube ID. \r\n\r\nCurrently we are unable to access captions via the YouTube API, so even if the video is already \r\ncaptioned on YouTube, captions will need to be included redundantly within *Able Player* \r\nas described above in the Closed Captions section.  \r\n\r\nMIME Types\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf your media doesn’t play, one possibility is that your web server is\r\nattempting to serve up the media with the incorrect MIME type. On\r\nApache, this can be correct by adding the following commands to the\r\n.htaccess file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Audio MIME Types\r\nAddType audio/mpeg mp3\r\nAddType audio/mp4 mp4 \r\nAddType audio/mp4 mpa\r\nAddType audio/ogg ogg\r\nAddType audio/ogg oga\r\nAddType audio/wav wav \r\n\r\n# Video MIME Types\r\nAddType video/mp4 mp4\r\nAddType video/ogg ogv\r\nAddType video/webm webm\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don’t have access to your server’s .htaccess file, you should be\r\nable to view and add MIME types somewhere within your server’s control\r\npanel.\r\n\r\nIf your site is running on a Windows server, consult the documentation\r\nfrom Microsoft. For example:\r\n\r\n-   [Configuring MIME Types in IIS 7][]\r\n-   [How to add MIME Types with IIS7 Web.config][]\r\n\r\nKeyboard Shortcuts\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n*Able Player* includes several keyboard shortcuts that enable users to control the\r\nplayer from anywhere on the web page, as follows:\r\n\r\n-   **p or spacebar** = Play/Pause\r\n-   **s** = Stop\r\n-   **r** = Rewind 10 seconds\r\n-   **f** = Forward10 seconds\r\n-   **c** = Toggle captions\r\n-   **m** = Mute\r\n-   **u or 1-5** = Volume Up\r\n-   **d or 1-5** = Volume Down\r\n-   **t** = Settings\r\n-   **h** = Help\r\n\r\nNote that modifier keys (Alt, Control, and Shift) can be assigned by clicking\r\nthe Preferences button on the player. If users find that shortcut keys\r\naren’t working as advertised, they might have better success by\r\nselecting different combinations of modifier keys to accompany the\r\ndefault shortcut keys.\r\n\r\nBy default, keyboard shortcuts must be accompanied by Alt + Control. \r\n\r\nUser Preferences\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nOne of *Able Player’s* accessibility features is that the player is\r\nhighly customizable by users. The controller includes a Preferences\r\nbutton that allows users to change default preferences and settings.\r\nTheir changes are stored in a browser cookie and in most cases should\r\ntherefore be preserved the next time they visit the site. Specifically,\r\nusers can control the following:\r\n\r\n-   Modifier keys: Add *Alt*, *Ctrl*, or *Shift* to the Able Player keyboard\r\n    shortcuts to avoid conflicts with other applications.\r\n-   Closed captions on by default\r\n-   Description on by default\r\n-   Use text-based description if available.\r\n-   Automatically pause video when text-based description starts\r\n-   If using text-based description, make it visible\r\n-   Transcript on by default \r\n-   Highlight transcript as video plays\r\n-   Keyboard-enable transcript\r\n\r\n\r\n  [examples]: http://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer/tests/\r\n  [jQuery]: http://jquery.com/\r\n  [Modernizr]: http://modernizr.com/\r\n  [jquery.cookie]: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie\r\n  [JW Player]: http://www.jwplayer.com/\r\n  [WebAIM’s 2014 Screen Reader User Survey]: http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey5/#browsers\r\n  [Configuring MIME Types in IIS 7]: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17bda1f4-8a0d-440f-986a-5aaa9d40b74c.aspx\r\n  [How to add MIME Types with IIS7 Web.config]: http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2008/03/25/how-to-add-mime-types-with-iis7-web-config.aspx\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
